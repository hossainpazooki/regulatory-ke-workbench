# Optional visualization dependencies for KE Workbench
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-visualization.txt
#
# NOTE: The tree visualizations use a custom HTML renderer that works
# without any external dependencies. This file is kept for potential
# future visualization enhancements.
#
# Supertree is for ML decision tree visualization (sklearn models),
# NOT for arbitrary tree data structures. We don't currently use it.

# No additional dependencies required - tree visualization uses pure HTML/CSS/JS
